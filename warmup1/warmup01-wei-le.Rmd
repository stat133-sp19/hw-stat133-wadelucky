# Cooking Recipe
## How to make chocolate puddle cakes

* ingredients
  
  - 4 tablespoons (55 grams) unsalted butter, cut into chunks, plus more for dishes
  - 2 teaspoons cocoa powder, plus more for dusting
  - 3 ounces (85 grams) bittersweet chocolate, roughly chopped
  - 1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt or a couple pinches of flaky salt
  - 1 to 2 tablespoons (13 to 25 grams) granulated sugar (see Note)
  - 1 large egg
  - 1 egg yolk
    
* _ "special" kitchen tools_

    - ramekins
    - a medium heatproof bowl
    - microwave
    - two baking dishes
    - oven
    
* __steps__

    1. Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Butter two 6-ounce ramekins or baking cups, making sure not to miss any spots
    2. Spoon a little cocoa powder in each and pat it around so it coats the bottom and sides, then knock the excess out.
    3. Place 4 tablespoons butter and chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl
    4. Whisk in egg and yolk and beat a good 20 to 30 extra times
    5. Divide between two baking dishes. Bake 7 to 9 minutes
    6. Eat immediately

# Euclidean Distance

### Definition

---------------------------------
The **Euclidean Distance** bewteen points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline{pq}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (p1, p2,..., pn) and **q** = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then\
the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

\[
d(\mathbf{p,q})=d(\mathbf{q,p})=\sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2+(q_1-p_2)^2+\dots+(q_n-p_n)^2}\\=
\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (q_i-p_i)^2}
\]

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as\
Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at\
the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of\
the vector:

\[
\|\mathbf{p}\|=\sqrt{p_1^2+p_2^2+\dots+p_n^2}=\sqrt{\mathbf{p\cdot p}},
\]

where the last expression involves the dot product.
