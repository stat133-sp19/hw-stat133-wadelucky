Cooking Recipe

How to make chocolate puddle cakes
----------------------------------

-   ingredients

-   4 tablespoons (55 grams) unsalted butter, cut into chunks, plus more for dishes
-   2 teaspoons cocoa powder, plus more for dusting
-   3 ounces (85 grams) bittersweet chocolate, roughly chopped
-   1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt or a couple pinches of flaky salt
-   1 to 2 tablespoons (13 to 25 grams) granulated sugar (see Note)
-   1 large egg
-   1 egg yolk

-   \_ "special" kitchen tools\_

    -   ramekins
    -   a medium heatproof bowl
    -   microwave
    -   two baking dishes
    -   oven

-   **steps**

    1.  Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Butter two 6-ounce ramekins or baking cups, making sure not to miss any spots
    2.  Spoon a little cocoa powder in each and pat it around so it coats the bottom and sides, then knock the excess out.
    3.  Place 4 tablespoons butter and chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl
    4.  Whisk in egg and yolk and beat a good 20 to 30 extra times
    5.  Divide between two baking dishes. Bake 7 to 9 minutes
    6.  Eat immediately

Euclidean Distance
==================

### Definition

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean Distance** bewteen points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\overline{pq}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (p1, p2,..., pn) and **q** = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then
the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$
d(\\mathbf{p,q})=d(\\mathbf{q,p})=\\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2+(q\_1-p\_2)^2+\\dots+(q\_n-p\_n)^2}\\\\=
\\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n} (q\_i-p\_i)^2}
$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as
Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at
the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of
the vector:

$$
\\|\\mathbf{p}\\|=\\sqrt{p\_1^2+p\_2^2+\\dots+p\_n^2}=\\sqrt{\\mathbf{p\\cdot p}},
$$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
