# Workout01

This home work is about download the data of Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, and Stephen Curry's data during Season 16-17.

We are going to dig into some specific data in them.

In data-dictionary.md, you can find some terminologies there.

In make-shots-data-script.R, you may find the whole data I'm using for this workout.

In make-shot-charts-script.R, this is the place where I generate my hot shot graphs for them.

In workout01-wei-le.Rmd, I typed a report for this workout which has just over 1,000 words, it's almost a miracle for non-native, exchange students like me. Trust me, I've never written such a long essay.

In workout01-wei-le.md, this is the output of my Rmd file, which is a github_document form, easy to ready and understand.
